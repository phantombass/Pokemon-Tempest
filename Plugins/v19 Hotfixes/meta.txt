#
# Essentials will crash if you press F12 to cause a soft reset.
# This cannot be fixed by a plugin, but here are instructions to
# fix it yourself:
#
# Search for the below line of code...
#
#     alias mkxp_draw_text draw_text
#
# ...and replace it with this line of code:
#
#     alias mkxp_draw_text draw_text unless method_defined?(:mkxp_draw_text)
